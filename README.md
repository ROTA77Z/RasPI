# RasPI
Raspberry Pi Audio/Video Application

Use Raspberry Pi zero for video player with DAC(Pirate Audio).
This section video control trial by python.

On other project use ST7789 for display movie on it.
(Pi4 can it, I trinig it on PiZero)

Pimoroni Audio Dac Shim (PIM542).
If you don't push the board all the way into the pins on the Raspberry Pi, the contact may not work. If you use extension pins, they may not be thick enough to cause contact problems. (I had a hard time with that)
